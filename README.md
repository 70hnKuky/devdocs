### Welcome to the Helium network

The Helium network enables long range, low power, bi-directional communication for LoRaWAN compatible devices.  

The Helium network is open, permissionless, and requires no up-front payments, contracts or commitments to use. Devices pay Hotspot owners on a per-packet basis using Data Credits for packets that are delivered to the appropriate network server.

In this developer documentation you will find examples, tutorials, specifications, and API references for building devices to run on the Helium network.
