# Transaction Fees

Like most blockchains, Helium has a system of transaction fees.  All transactions in the Helium blockchain are paid in [Data Credits ](tokens.md#data-credits)\(DCs\). Data Credits are produced via burning some amount of `HNT` using an on-chain transaction. And thanks to a system called "Implicit Burn", users \(typically\) don't need to manually supply `DCs` to pay fees. As long as the Helium wallet being used to submit the transaction contains enough `HNT` to burn to `DCs` to fund the transaction, the burn will happen implicitly, requiring no user intervention.  

### Transaction Fee Schedule

The following is a list of the current set of fees required for various transactions, along with their details. Transaction fees are paid in [Data Credits](tokens.md#data-credits).

\(Note that the cost is not shown in `HNT` as this number is variable based on the current $USD/HNT price as defined by the [HNT Price Oracle](hnt-price-oracles.md).\)
{% endhint %}

| Fee Type | Fee Description | **Cost \(DC\)** | Cost \(USD\) | Required As Of |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Send HNT | Transferring HNT from wallet to wallet | `35000` | `$.35` | `6/29/2020` |
| Transferring Device Packet Data | Fee paid by device owner when sending or receiving sensor data. Metered per 24 bytes. | `1` | `$.00001` | `Not Yet Required` |
| Add Gateway | Fee paid to add Gateway to the blockchain. \(**Only applies to non-Helium Hotspots.\)** | `4000000` | `$40` | `6/29/2020` |
| Assert Gateway Location | Required when asserting a Gateway's location. \(The **first location assertion** for Helium Hotspots is paid by Helium Inc. \) | `1000000` | `$10` | `6/29/2020` |
| Purchasing a blockchain OUI  | Buy an OUI from the Helium blockchain | `10000000` | `$100` | `Not Yet Required` |
| Purchasing a blockchain Subnet | Buy a Subnet from the Helium blockchain | `10000000` | `$100` | `Not Yet Required` |

### Transaction Fees and Implicit Burn 

The Helium blockchain uses something called `implicit burn` when paying  fees. 

{% hint style="info" %}
**Implicit Burnâ„¢** 

The term _implicit burn_ was coined by Helium PM Coco "cokes" Tang, a recognized innovator in the blockchain technology and terminology space.
{% endhint %}

Thanks to Implicit Burn,  if you have enough HNT to pay the transaction fee in your wallet,  the Helium Mobile Wallet \(or the [Helium Wallet CLI](blockchain-cli.md)\) will calculate the cost into your transaction and automatically burn the precise amount of HNT to supply the required DCs for the transaction. For example:

* You need to send `10HNT` from a Helium Wallet that contains `11HNT` 
* The cost for this `send` transaction is `35000 DCs`
* Let's assume the  `HNT/$USD` [Oracle Price](hnt-price-oracles.md) is `$.35` at the time you send the `HNT`. This means that you'll need to supply a `1HNT` to fund the `35000 DCs` for this transaction. 
* When you send the `10HNT`, the Helium Wallet automatically supplies the `1HNT` to be burned into `DCs`. 
* After the transaction is submitted and processed, your resulting Helium Wallet balance will be `0HNT`

In the above example, had you attempted to send `10.0001HNT` with only. `11HNT` in your wallet, this transaction would have failed as burning `.999HNT` would only result in `34965 DCs`, a bit short of the`35000` required for a `send` transaction. 

### Failed Transactions Result in No DCs Being Spent

Transactions in the Helium blockchain are `atomic`. In short, this means that they either succeed entirely or they don't. So, if you attempt to send HNT from a Helium Wallet without enough HNT to supply the required Data Credits, the transaction will fail after being submitted to the blockchain API by you wallet. And your `HNT` balance will be the same. No `DCs` were burned \(or harmed\) in this failed transaction.
