# Mining and Token Rewards

Hotspot Hosts and other Helium Network participants have many questions about expected mining rewards. This is understandable. Earning HNT is one of the most excitin piecse of the Helium Network. 

While at this point we can't give a precise formula for calculating how much HNT you'll earn over a given period, there are some higher level concepts, design elements, and rules to keep in mind that will help better explain what you might earn and why. This section covers these.

## Target HNT per Epoch

The target production rate for new HNT minted per month is `5,000,000`. Take note of "target". This means that, if the blockchain performs as designed, it will produce `5,000,000` HNT per month. But that target rate is attainable only if the two following things are true for any given continuous month:

* The average **block time** is `30` seconds;
* Average **epoch size** is `30` blocks;

Recall that, in the Helium blockchain, [blocks]() contain some number of individual transactions and [epochs]() are comprosed of all the blocks mined by a the current Consensus Group since the last epoch. 

So, if we acheive our target block time of `30` seconds, and target epoch of `30` blocks, the blockchain will produce `5MM` HNT per month. Per epoch, this equals roughly `3424.66` HNT. 

* `43800` minutes in the average month;
* `30` minutes per epoch 
* `1460` epochs per month
* This results in `3424.66` HNT per epoch (`3424.65753424658` HNT to be precises)

That said, this target number is hard to attain, and the Helium team is working on getting as close to it as possible. The Helium Network is still very new and growing quite quickly, so there are many bugs to be squashed and optimizations to be made.

## HNT per Epoch 

As calculated above, the target HNT per epoch is approximately `3424.66`. The next logical question is "Where does all this HNT go?" Let's take a look.
