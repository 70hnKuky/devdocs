# Getting Started - Onboarding Devices

This section will cover the initial steps needed to create a test device for the Helium Network. 

* Check your area for network coverage
* Register an account on Helium Console 
* Add a device to Helium Console and record device details 

## Network Coverage

First, youâ€™ll need access to the Helium Network. To check your area for coverage, we have provided a network visualizer tool that displays the current distribution of Helium hotspots. 

<a href="https://network.helium.com/coverage" target="_blank">Helium Network Visualizer</a>

If you do not see any hotspots in your area, you would need to purchase one from the <a href="https://www.helium.com/store" target="_blank">Helium Store</a>.

Alternatively, you can build your own development hotspot using [this guide] (https://developer.helium.com/hotspot/developer-setup).

## Create an account

To register for an account, visit <a href="https://console.helium.com" target="_blank">Helium Console</a> and click **Register**.

During Registration, you'll be asked to provide an Organization name and a Team name.

Organization name should represent the top level owner of the account. Team name may be whatever you'd like. 

### Confirm your account
A confirmation email will be sent to the email address used to create an account. You must confirm the account in order to continue using Console. If you did not receive an email, please check your spam folders.

## Device Management

Helium Console allows developers to add devices and grab the device identifiers to load onto their device firmware that authenticates and identifies the device for the Helium Network.

### Add a Device

To add a device, go to **Devices** and click the **+** icon on the bottom right of the window.

When prompted, enter a name for your device. Names do not have to be unique as every device has a unique device identifier.

> ##### Important!  

Make sure you record the `OUI` and `device id`, which will be needed when you program your device. 

For example: 

```
const uint32_t oui = 1;
const uint16_t device_id = 2;
const uint8_t preshared_key[16] = {0xF4, 0xF2, 0xAB, 0x28, 0xA9, 0x9B, 0xAB, 0x44, 0x95, 0x71, 0x52, 0x4E, 0xE1, 0xCA, 0x13, 0xCE};
```

Now that we've added a device on Console, let's build our device!
