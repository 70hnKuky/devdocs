# Quickstart  

This quickstart will cover the initial steps needed to create a test device for the Helium Network. 

* Check your area for network coverage
* Register an account on Helium Console 
* Add a device to Helium Console and record device details 

## Network Coverage

First, youâ€™ll need to be within range of the Helium Network. To check your area for coverage, we have provided a network visualizer tool that displays the current distribution of Helium hotspots. 

<a href="https://network.helium.com/coverage" target="_blank">Helium Network Visualizer</a>

If you do not see any hotspots in your area, we have a few options available. You can purchase a Hotspot by sending a request to developer@helium.com. 

Alternatively, if you'd like to get your hands dirty, we have [instructions](/hotspot/developer-setup) on how to build your own Hotspot for LongFi packet forwarding using off the shelf components. Note that this Hotspot is designed to only forward packets, and not mine Helium tokens. 

## Create an account

To register for an account, visit <a href="https://console.helium.com" target="_blank">Helium Console</a> and click **Register**.

During Registration, you'll be asked to provide an Organization name and a Team name.

Define an Organization name for the top level owner of the account (ie: company name). Think of Teams as a way to organize groups of devices.

### Confirm your account
A confirmation email will be sent to the email address used to create an account. You must confirm the account in order to continue using Console. If you did not receive an email, please check your spam folders.

## Device Management

Helium Console allows developers to add devices and grab the device identifiers to load onto their device firmware that authenticates and identifies the device for the Helium Network.

### Add a Device

To add a device, go to **Devices** and click the **+** icon on the bottom right of the window.

When prompted, enter a name for your device. Names do not have to be unique as every device has a unique device identifier.

> ##### Important!  
> Make sure you record the `OUI` and `device id`, which will be needed when you program your device. 
This is a Proof of Coverage Challenge, as seen in the Helium Network Visualizer
For example: 

```
const uint32_t oui = 1;
const uint16_t device_id = 2;
const uint8_t preshared_key[16] = {0xF4, 0xF2, 0xAB, 0x28, 0xA9, 0x9B, 0xAB, 0x44, 0x95, 0x71, 0x52, 0x4E, 0xE1, 0xCA, 0x13, 0xCE};
```

Now that we've added a device on Console, let's build our device!
