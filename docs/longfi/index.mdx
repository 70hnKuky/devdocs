# LongFi

LongFi is where the Helium blockchain and the LoRaWAN radio protocol intersect. The uniqueness of LongFi versus a traditional LoRaWAN architecture is that we use the blockchain (sometimes called a `decentralized ledger`) to enable routing to many Network Servers. 

Illustrated in the graphic below, LongFi improves on the standard LoRaWAN deployment with a blockchain-based OUI mechanism that enables seamless roaming across the entire Helium Network for any device.
