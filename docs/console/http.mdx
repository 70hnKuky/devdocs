# HTTP Integration

## Add an HTTP Channel

To add a channel, go to **Integrations** on the left menu. Select the channel to add - in this case, the **HTTP** channel.

The next step is to paste the HTTP endpoint.

If you're still testing, you can find popular sites that can create HTTP endpoints for you and inspect packets. <a href="https://www.requestbin.com">Requestbin </a> and <a href="https://www.beeceptor.com">Beeceptor </a>provide tools to make an HTTP endpoint quickly and easily.

To transfer data to request bin continue with the example below. However, if you want to trigger services with device data go [here](/console/trigger-ifttt).

### Requestbin Example
Create an endpoint by going to requestbin.com and click **Create a Request Bin**. Once created, copy the endpoint.

<img src={request_bin} />

... and paste it in Console.

<img src={pasted_endpoint} />

**HTTP Header** and **Value** are not required and those can be left blank. 

Lastly, provide a name for the channel. Names do not have to be unique.

Click **Create Channel**.

Your new channel is now ready for use.

### Set Multiple Channels
Devices can send the same data packet to multiple channels at once. This is a cost-effective way to send the same information to many places at once without re-sending the data from the IoT device.

To send to another channel, click **Connect Channel**, select a channel, and click **Add**.

### Set Default Channel 
[setchannel]: #setchannel

To set a channel as the default for all newly created devices, go to **Channels** on the left menu and click **Set Default** for the desired channel.

### Channel Details 
View the details of your channel by clicking on the Channel name. 

**Channel Details** shows the channel ID that is unique to each channel, the name, the type of channel, and whether it is active or ont.

**HTTP Details** shows the specific endpoint. Editing endpoints is not available in the SDK Beta and will be coming soon. If you no longer want to use a channel, simply create a new one and redirect existing devices using the old channel to use the new one.

**Devices Piped** lists all the devices that are currently sending their data to the selected channel.

**Update Channel** allows you to update your HTTP connection details for the currently viewed channel.
