## Cargo Endpoint

**
HTTP Details  
Method: post  
Endpoint: https://cargo.helium.com/api/payloads

## Cargo Payload

The Cargo payload defines the content and structure of the data payload that must be sent to the cargo endpoint.

**Total Payload: 12 Bytes**  

**Packed in the following order:** 
* int32_t Latitude in Degrees
* int32_t longitude in Degrees
* int16_t Altitude in Meters
* uint16_t Speed in km/h

#### Example in C:
```
if (GPS.hasFix) {
    data = (uint32_t)(GPS.latitudeDegrees * 1E7);
    payload[idx++] = data >> 24;
    payload[idx++] = data >> 16;
    payload[idx++] = data >> 8;
    payload[idx++] = data;
    data = (uint32_t)(GPS.longitudeDegrees * 1E7);
    payload[idx++] = data >> 24;    
    payload[idx++] = data >> 16;
    payload[idx++] = data >> 8;
    payload[idx++] = data;
    data = (int)(GPS.altitude);
    payload[idx++] = data >> 8;
    payload[idx++] = data;    
    data = (int)(GPS.speed);
    payload[idx++] = data >> 8;
    payload[idx++] = data;
}    
```
