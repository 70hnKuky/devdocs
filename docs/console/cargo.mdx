## Add a Cargo Integration

To add an integration, go to **Integrations** on the left menu. Select the integration to add - in this case, the **Cargo** integration.  

The next step is name this Cargo integration.

## Cargo Payload

The Cargo payload defines the content and structure of the data payload that must be sent to the cargo endpoint.

**Total Payload:** 
  * 12 Bytes without Battery Voltage
  * 14 Bytes with Battery Voltage

**Packed in the following order:** 
* int32_t Latitude in Degrees
* int32_t longitude in Degrees
* int16_t Elevation in Meters
* int16_t Speed in mph
* uint16_t Battery Voltage (Optional)

#### Example:
```
if (GPS.hasFix) { 
    idx = 0;
    data = (uint32_t)(GPS.latitudeDegrees * 1E7);
    payload[idx++] = data >> 24;
    payload[idx++] = data >> 16;
    payload[idx++] = data >> 8;
    payload[idx++] = data;
    data = (uint32_t)(GPS.longitudeDegrees * 1E7);
    payload[idx++] = data >> 24;    
    payload[idx++] = data >> 16;
    payload[idx++] = data >> 8;
    payload[idx++] = data;
    data = (int)(GPS.altitude);
    payload[idx++] = data >> 8;
    payload[idx++] = data;    
    data = (int)(GPS.speed);
    payload[idx++] = data >> 8;
    payload[idx++] = data;
}    
```
