# MQTT Integration

## Add an MQTT Integration

To add an integration, go to **Integrations** on the left menu. Select the integration to add - in this case, the **MQTT** integration.

The next step is to paste your MQTT broker endpoint, and optional topic prefix.

### MQTT Topic composition:

**Device Uplink (Receive Data from Device)**  
Subscribe to:  
{optional_prefix}/helium/{Device ID}/rx  

Example with prefix: `mqtt/helium/3c822699-37fd-4df6-a84d-93037a450843/rx`  
Example without prefix: `helium/3c822699-37fd-4df6-a84d-93037a450843/rx` 

**Device Downlink (Send Data to Device)**  
Publish to:  
{optional_prefix}/helium/{Device ID}/tx  

Example with prefix: `mqtt/helium/3c822699-37fd-4df6-a84d-93037a450843/tx`  
Example without prefix: `helium/3c822699-37fd-4df6-a84d-93037a450843/tx` 

**Sending Data to Device:**  
Use the `payload_raw` field with a base64 encoded array of bytes.  
JSON Example:
```
{
   "payload_raw": "encoded_string"
}
```

## Connecting Integrations to Devices

Devices are connected to integrations through the use of Labels. Labels are named identifiers, that can be used to associate an integration
with a device. To connect one or more devices to one or more integrations, simply attach the same label to both the device and integration.
Labels need to be created before attaching them to devices and integrations, instructions [here](/console/labels).

## Send and Receive Device Data

The following examples are done with the [MQTT CLI](https://hivemq.github.io/mqtt-cli) utility.

Example MQTT 

**Subscribe to Uplink Packets:**
```
mqtt sub -V 3 -t helium/3c822699-37fd-4df6-a84d-93037a450843/rx -h {mqtt_broker_host} -p {mqtt_broker_host_port} -u "user" -pw "password"
```

**Publish Downlink Packet:**
```
mqtt pub -V 3 -t helium/3c822699-37fd-4df6-a84d-93037a450843/tx -h {mqtt_broker_host} -p {mqtt_broker_host_port} -u "user" -pw "password" -m "{\"payload_raw\":\"encoded_string\"}"
```
