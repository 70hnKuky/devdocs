# Console

Helium Console is a device management tool hosted by Helium and allows developers to register, authenticate, and manage their devices to use on the Helium Network. In addition to device management, Console will provide services to route device data to HTTP endpoints, MQTT topics (coming soon), and popular cloud solutions like Google Cloud IoT (coming soon), Azure (coming soon) and more. 

Device Management includes:
- Organization structure with projects and subproject, and user-level permissions
- Device ID registration and seamless, secure onboarding and authentication
- Data Credits (purchasing and payments) to Hotspots for utilizing the Helium Network
