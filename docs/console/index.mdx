# The Helium Console

The <a href="http://console.helium.com/" target="_blank">Helium Console</a> is a web-based device management tool hosted by Helium that allows developers to register, authenticate, and manage their devices on the Helium Network. In addition to device management, Console provides prebuilt connections called Integrations to route device data via HTTPs or MQTT; or directly to cloud services like AWS IoT, GCP IoT, and Azure IoT.

Device Management includes:
- Organization structure with labels, and user-level permissions
- Device ID registration and seamless, secure onboarding and authentication
- Data Credits (purchasing and payments) to Hotspots for utilizing the Helium Network


**Note: In order for device packet data to route to the internet, you'll need to be within range of the Helium Network. To check if there is coverage in your area, view our <a href="https://network.helium.com" target="_blank">coverage map</a>.**

> #### IMPORTANT:  
> The cost per packet is $0.00001 USD (24 byte packets) which is equivalent to 1 Data Credit (DC).
> During the Beta there is no cost to send packets
