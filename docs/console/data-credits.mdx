# Data Credits 

> #### IMPORTANT:  
> The cost per packet is $0.00001 USD (24 byte packets) which is equivalent to 1 Data Credit (DC).
> During the Beta there is no cost to send packets.

When a valid data packet is received from that device, a dot will appear from the left side of the chart and flow towards the right as time goes on.

Blue dots represent packets that have been successfully sent to endpoints, while orange dots have failed to reach an endpoint, and red dots do not have a defined endpoint.

The size of the dot is related to the size of the packet. Larger sized packets will be a larger dot, and small data packets will be a smaller dot.

> #### IMPORTANT: 
> Data is not stored in the Console so the Console window must be open in order to view live packets.

### Event Log
Event Logs display real-time packets in table form. See which Hotspot received the packet, its RSSI, and the size of the packet.

Follow these instructions to use the Console to set up a Channel to route data. A Helium Channel is a pre-built, secure connection from Helium-enabled devices straight through to a configured endpoint. When data arrives from a device, the Helium routing infrastructure ensures delivery of your encrypted data.
