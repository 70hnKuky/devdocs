# Device 

#### The devices are what the Helium network exist for. Here you will learn about the pieces that make up a Helium device and how you can quickly get started! 

Any [LoRaWAN](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan) device can communicate on the Helium network if provisioned appropriately. The AppEui and AppKey must be configured appropriately so that Helium Miners may route the data to the appropriate Helium Router.
