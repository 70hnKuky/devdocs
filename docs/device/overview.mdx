# Device 

#### The devices are what the Helium network exist for. Here you will learn about the pieces that make up a Helium device and how you can quickly get started! 

Any device can communicate on the Helium network if it adheres to the [LoRa](https://www.semtech.com/lora/what-is-lora) 
modulation specification for its locale and follows the [LongFi Protocol](https://developer.helium.com/longfi/overview). 
Helium has developed several foundational pieces to facilitate developers at all stages of development. Starting with [LongFi Core](https://github.com/helium/longfi-core)
, a library which provides LongFi protocol primitives to both device and host implementations. Next, building on top of LongFi Core, 
[LongFi Device](https://github.com/helium/longfi-device) is a portable device-side implementation in C for 
the Semtech SX12xx line. Lastly, sample applications are provided, targeting two development boards in C and Rust, 
with the popular [CMWX1ZZABZ](https://wireless.murata.com/type-abz.html) module from Murata containing a Semtech SX1276 and STM32L0.
