# LongFi ST HAL Quickstart 

This guide will show you step by step how to transmit LongFi packets using a longfi-st-hal example on an STMicroelectronics B-L072Z-LRWAN1 Discovery kit.

To follow along, you'll need the following:
* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Any distro of linux should work, but we've only tested on this)
* [STMicroelectronics B-L072Z-LRWAN1 Discovery kit](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-l072z-lrwan1.html)
* [GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads)
* [OpenOCD](https://github.com/ntfreak/openocd)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
* [Cortex Debug Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marus25.cortex-debug)

Let's start by cloning the `longfi-st-hal` repository.
```
git clone git@github.com:helium/longfi-st-hal.git
```
Next we'll navigate to the TransmitPacket example directory and launch vs code from there.
```
cd longfi-st-hal/Boards/B-L072Z-LRWAN1/Examples/TransmitPacket
code .
```

Next, we'll use the Cortex Debug extension in VS code to debug our firmware example.
First lets enter debug view by clicking the bug icon on the far left.
Next, we'll click the drop down next to the Debug play symbol in the top left, and select `Add Configuration...`.

### Cortex Debug Launch Config 
```
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Cortex Debug",
            "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
            "executable": "./build/B-L072Z-LRWAN1.elf",
            "request": "launch",
            "type": "cortex-debug",
            "servertype": "openocd",
            "device": "STM32L072CZ",
            "configFiles": [
                "interface/stlink-v2.cfg",
                "target/stm32l0.cfg"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
