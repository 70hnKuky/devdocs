The next step is to name the integration

Last, apply any optional Labels. For more information on Labels please visit the [Labels guide](https://github.com/helium/devdocs/tree/67b988ec351854ec4b7608e12b5b8f47f2456abf/console/labels/README.md).

## Connecting Integrations to Devices

Devices are connected to integrations through the use of Labels. Labels are named identifiers, that can be used to associate an integration with a device. To connect one or more devices to one or more integrations, simply attach the same label to both the device and integration. Labels need to be created before attaching them to devices and integrations.
