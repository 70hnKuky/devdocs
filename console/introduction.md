The [Helium Console](http://console.helium.com/) is a an open source web-based device management tool that allows developers to register, authenticate, and manage their devices on the Helium network. In addition to device management, Console provides prebuilt connections called Integrations to route device data via HTTPs or MQTT; or directly to cloud services like AWS IoT, GCP IoT, and Azure IoT.

Device Management includes:

* Organization structure with labels, and user-level permissions
* Device ID registration and seamless, secure onboarding and authentication
* Data Credits for utilizing the Helium Network

Console is available as a free to use hosted application at [https://console.helium.com](https://console.helium.com), or can be downloaded and hosted on your own infrastructure. The code is available online at [https://github.com/helium/console](https://github.com/helium/console) and can be run on any linux or macOS system.
