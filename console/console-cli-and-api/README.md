# Console CLI and API

A web-based dashboard is ideal for getting started. When it comes time to do more than just a couple devices though, doing “just a few clicks” a dozen times is enough to drive any IoT developer insane. And when it comes to shipping a few thousand, it’s just not an option.

The Console API let's you interact with the console via HTTP Requests.  You can either do that directly using the HTTP API or you can leverage the CLI, which abstracts the API and provides higher level features like importing devices from other network providers.
