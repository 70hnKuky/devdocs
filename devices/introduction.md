description: Details on how to add devices to the Helium Network

# Introduction

The Helium Network was built to transfer device data. Here you will learn about the pieces that make up a Helium device and how you can quickly get started! Any device can communicate on the Helium network if it uses the [LoRaWAN wireless protocol](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan).

## Adding New Devices

If you're ready to add your LoRaWAN devices to the Helium Network, head over the [Console Quickstart](https://github.com/helium/devdocs/tree/316a0ffe46a00cd9398f98332e75206bc437c93c/console/quickstart/README.md).

We also have a growing list of sensors we've[ pre-certified and documented on the Helium Network](lorawan-devices/) for your convenience.

### Developing A New Device

**LongFi Arduino**

The LongFi Arduino repository provides example Sketches that help LoRaWAN capable Arduino devices connect to the Helium Network.

### Migrating Devices to the Helium Network

Do you have devices deployed on another network like TTN, Senet, or MachineQ? Great. We have you covered. Head over to our [Device Migration Guides.](migrating-devices-to-helium/)
