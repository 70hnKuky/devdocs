# Migrating Devices to Helium

![](../../.gitbook/assets/artboard-copy-28.jpg)

If you already have LoRaWAN devices deployed on another network, you can easily migrate them to the Helium Network. Typically this only involves adding your existing `DevEUI`, `AppEUI`, and `AppKey` to a new device in the Helium Console \(and we'll soon have a CLI that scripts some or all of this process for you\).

The following is a list of network-specific migration guides. Join us!
