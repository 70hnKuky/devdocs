# Introduction

The Helium Network was built to transfer device data. Here you will learn about the pieces that make up a Helium device and how you can quickly get started!

Any device can communicate on the Helium network if it uses the [LoRaWAN wireless protocol](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan).

### Adding New Devices

For information on how to add new LoRaWAN devices, visit the [Console Quickstart](https://github.com/helium/devdocs/tree/316a0ffe46a00cd9398f98332e75206bc437c93c/console/quickstart/README.md).

#### Developing A New Device

**LongFi Arduino**

The LongFi Arduino repository provides example Sketches that help LoRaWAN capable Arduino devices connect to the Helium Network.

### Migrating Devices

If you already have LoRaWAN devices deployed on another network and would like to migrate your devices, [you can easily do so by updating the device's DevEUI/AppEUI/AppKey](device-migration.md).
