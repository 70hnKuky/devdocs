# LoRaWAN Gateway Migration

![](../../.gitbook/assets/hotspot_migration.png)

In this section, we’ll go over some off-the-shelf LoRaWAN gateways that Helium has tested and vetted, along with the steps to configure them to serve as hotspots on the Helium Network. This page will be updated as we continue to test more gateways.

**LoRaWAN Gateways:**

{% hint style="danger" %}
**You are about to build a Hotspot that will not mine HNT.**

The ability to mine HNT with a 3rd party gateway is not yet supported. Please join the [Helium Discord Server](https://discord.gg/helium) and the \#hotspot-diy-hardware channel for the latest updates on the roadmap. 

Once again, if you build a DIY Hotspot, it will only route Helium LoRaWAN Packets. It would not earn HNT.
