## Helium Hotspot

The Helium Hotspot is a combination [LongFi](../longfi/introduction.md) wireless router and Helium [Blockchain](../blockchain/introduction.md) miner built and distributed by Helium, Inc. It creates a long-range network for routing packets from Helium LongFi-enabled devices and performs ongoing mining duties to secure the Helium Network. The "Helium Hotspot" is the name of the Hotspot designed, manufactured, and distributed by Helium, Inc. Developers can use the information provided here to build other "Hotspot" variants that conform to the published network specifications.

## Developer Hotspot

{% hint style="danger" %}
**You are about to build a Hotspot that will not mine HNT.**

The ability to mine HNT with a 3rd party gateway is not yet supported. Please join the [Helium Discord Server](https://discord.gg/helium) and the \#hotspot-diy-hardware channel for the latest updates on the roadmap. 

Once again, if you build a DIY Hotspot, it will only route Helium LoRaWAN Packets. It would not earn HNT.
{% endhint %}

The [Helium Developer Hotspot](developer-setup.md) is a Hotspot that can be built using off-the-shelf components that is capable of sending and receiving packets over the LongFi wireless network.
